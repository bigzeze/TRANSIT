# TRANSIT

## Introduction

**Tr**affic **An**omaly **Si**mulation **T**ool (TRANSIT) is a simulation tool to generate cross-level unified, reproducible, and controllable traffic anomaly scenarios, with detailed multimodal traffic anomlay simulation datasets. TRANSIT can be used in vaious road network scenarios, including real-world road networks, and supports diverse types of traffic anomalies.

## Installation

TRANSIT is developed based on SUMOâ€”a widely used, open source traffic simulation tool. SUMO should be installed firstly:
